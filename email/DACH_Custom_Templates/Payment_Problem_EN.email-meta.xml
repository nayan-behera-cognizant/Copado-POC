    <textOnly>Hello {!Account.FirstName},

Due to a processing error we have taken a payment incorrectly on your account.

We would like to apologise, and reassure you that refunds will be made directly. However, for some customers the refund can take up to 2 weeks due to banking clearing procedures, but you should see the refund in your chosen payment method before then.
We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any additional questions you can visit our help pages and FAQ on https://my.dazn.com/help/ or you can reply to this email.

Best regards,
Your DAZN Team</textOnly>
